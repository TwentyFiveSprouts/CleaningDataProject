## Cleaning Data Final Project Codebook

###  Origin of Data

The data in the set were collected by Samsung as part of a study on their
accelerometer. The data were collected from 30 people, ages 19-48. Each person
performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, 
SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) while wearing a smartphone. Accelerometer and 
gyroscopic data were collected.

Sensor signals included motion information in three directions (x, y, z). 

This work extracts mean and standard deviation from the x, y, and z data and
then further processes it to generate information for each subject on their
average x, y and z accelerometer readings while performing each activity. The 
resulting data are recorded in this file:

summarydata.txt

###  Structure of data output

The following files are included in this output:

This codebook
README.txt
summarydata.txt
run_analysis.R

Documentation of run_analysis.R is included in the readme file.

The format of the summarydata.txt file is as follows:

There are eight columns:

subject- an integer designating the assigned subject id. The range is 1-30

activity- factor variable describing the activity observed in each record. The 
possible values are WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING,
STANDING, LAYING.

xmean- a numeric variable representing the mean of all measurements in the 
x direction

ymean- a numeric variable representing the mean of all measurements in the 
y direction

zmean- a numeric variable representing the mean of all measurements in the 
z direction

xstddev- a numeric variable representing the standard deviation of all
measurements in the x direction

ysteddev- a numeric variable representing the standard deviation of all
measurements in the y direction

zstddev- a numeric variable representing the standard deviation of all
measurements in the z direction
